# Documentation and examples
If you're interested in contributing but don't feel ready to make big changes to the code, helping us to improve and expand our documentation and examples is an excellent way to get involved.

# Bug fixes and code cleanup
If you've spotted a bug or an oversight, the best idea is to open an issue on the issues page first so that other users can verify the issue or help localise it to a particular combination of OS and App version. Submit a pull request referencing the issue.

# New features
Create a new issue but select "New Feature" this way we can discuss the idea. After that you can create a new branch for the feature and submit a pull from the branch as it matures.  It's a good idea to start with an issue before diving in on development so you can hear from other users who may have tried something similar in the past.
